# CBH Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


#Challenges


Washington State ranks 43 out of 51 in the US for access to mental health services. For example, over 42% of Tacoma Public Schools (TPS) students face service barriers due to being economically disadvantaged. Accordingly, the WA Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) has deemed building staffing capacity to support student well-being as a key priority in 2021-23. Studies demonstrate that consultations that are transferable from behavioral health care experts to school staff are an efficient, scalable, cost-effective, and sustained model. However, this model has not been adopted in TPS. 


#Solution


CBH website is a product that  strengthen an established partnership between UW Tacoma, TPS and MultiCare Adolescent Behavioral Health Unit and conduct a needs assessment that will inform the development and implementation of a transferrable consultation program that supports student mental well-being.'
